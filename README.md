Setup instructions

Pre-requisites(for both Windows and Linux): Python 3

For Windows users:
  1) Make sure that python is added to your path!(open a command prompt and type in 'python'. If the python prompt appears, then you're good to go, otherwise, follow the instructions here: https://www.pythoncentral.io/add-python-to-path-python-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/ .
  2) Go to 'setup_win', and double-click on 'init.bat'.
  3) Launch the program by running 'run_win.bat'.
  
For Linux users:
  1) Open a terminal, go to 'setup_nix', and type 'bash init.sh' minus the quotes.
  2) Run the program by using the command 'python3 informer.py'.

Expect the process of actually using this program to become simpler once I figure out how to make Windows installers and their Linux equivalents!
